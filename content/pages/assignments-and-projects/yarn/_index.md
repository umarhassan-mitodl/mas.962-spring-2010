For this assignment you will make a yarn that consists of two or more different materials. You should make at least 2 yards of yarn.

Create a page that documents your project. Your page should contain pictures, including one or more microscopic close-ups and one or more regular photos of the yarn. The USB microscope will be attached to the Mac computer in our lab. Write a paragraph or two that describes how your yarn was made and justifies your choice of materials.

Measure and report the following properties (if they are relevant for your yarn):

*   diameter (micrometers)
*   total length of yarn (meters or yards)
*   ply
*   fiber length (millimeters)
*   twist direction
*   twist (turns per inch)
*   conductivity (ohms per centimeter or ohms per inch)

Bonus points for measuring any of the following properties and explaining how you did so:

*   denier or tex
*   yarn size
*   tenacity
*   elongation
*   elastic recovery
*   absorbency
