For this assignment you will work in teams, in collaboration with the *21W.789 Communicating with Mobile Technology* class, to build a textile that talks to a mobile phone. With your team you should create a webpage that documents your project. Your page should include pictures and a discussion of your experience. Also create a short video of your project in action; post the video online (Vimeo, YouTube, or your own site) and include a link to your video in your documentation page.
